# Development Guidelines

This guide provides mandatory rules for AI-assisted development in this Rust project.

## Mandatory Code Verification After Development

**CRITICAL**: After completing any code changes or implementing new features, the AI assistant MUST perform the following steps:

### 1. Run `cargo check` for Error Detection

After every code modification, run `cargo check` to verify the code compiles correctly:

```bash
cargo check
```

### 2. Fix All Errors Before Proceeding

- **All `error` level issues MUST be fixed** before considering the task complete
- Do NOT leave any compilation errors unresolved
- Continue iterating on fixes until `cargo check` passes without errors

### 3. Verification Workflow

The required workflow for any code change is:

1. Make code changes
2. Run `cargo check`
3. If errors exist:
   - Analyze the error messages
   - Fix all errors
   - Run `cargo check` again
   - Repeat until no errors remain
4. Only consider the task complete when `cargo check` passes

### Warning Handling

- Warnings (`warning`) should be addressed when reasonable, but are not blocking
- Focus on eliminating errors first, then address warnings if time permits

## Example Error Handling

```bash
# After making changes, run cargo check
cargo check

# If you see errors like:
# error[E0425]: cannot find value `x` in this scope
# error[E0308]: mismatched types

# You MUST fix these errors before proceeding!
# Make the necessary corrections, then run cargo check again:
cargo check

# Continue until you see:
# Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in X.XXs
```

## Summary

- **ALWAYS** run `cargo check` after code changes
- **ALWAYS** fix all compilation errors
- **NEVER** consider a task complete with unresolved errors
- This rule applies to ALL code modifications, no matter how small
